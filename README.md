# LeetCode Exercises ðŸ”¥

This repo will reflect our impementations of different LeetCode problems in order to prepare for Software Engineering interviews. 

## About LeetCode

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a popular online platform for practicing and improving coding skills. It offers a wide range of coding problems across different levels of difficulty, covering a variety of algorithmic and data structure concepts.

## Purpose of this Repository

The main purpose of this repository is to:

1. **Practice Coding**: By solving LeetCode exercises, we aim to continuously improve our problem-solving abilities, coding techniques, and understanding of data structures and algorithms.

2. **Track Progress**: This repository serves as a way to track my progress and growth as I work through more LeetCode problems over time.

3. **Code Documentation**: The solutions provided in this repository are well-documented, making it easier for me (and potentially others) to review, understand, and learn from the code.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
Leet/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ java
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ kotlin
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ topinterview150
â”‚           â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ arraystring
â”‚           â”‚   â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ MergedSortedArray.kt
â”‚           â”‚   â”‚    â””â”€â”€ RemoveElement.kt
â”‚           â”‚   â””â”€â”€ linkedlist
â”‚           â”‚        â”œâ”€â”€ PartitionList.kt
â”‚           â”‚        â””â”€â”€ RemoveNthNodeFromEnd.kt 
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ leetcode75
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- The `java` and `kotlin` directories contain solutions in the respective language. The contents of these two directories should mirror each other. 
- The `topinterview150` and `leetcode75` directories include solutions to LeetCode [Top Interview 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/) and [LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/) path. Other paths in the same level may be added in the future.
- The `README.md` file you're currently reading provides an overview of the repository and its purpose.

## Current paths/lists.

As seen in the repository structure, we are currently following a couple of paths. These are the paths that are proposed to fully complete in the mid-term:

1. [Top Interview 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/) path, but others will be added in the future. 
2. [LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/)
2. [Programming Skills](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/programming-skills/)

## Contribution

This repository is primarily for Israel Mendoza and Victor Bocanegra use, but if you find any of the solutions helpful or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

For each of the solutions, follow these recommendations: 

1. Create a class for each solution.
2. The name of the class should be close the the name of the problem to resolve.
3. Add the link to the LeetCode problem at the top of the file.
4. Have fun! ðŸ˜ƒ
